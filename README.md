# Discord timestamp bot 
A bot for creating timers: join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/Pswb8khdgQ) and ask for me to put it online!

synatx looks like:

`!timer [<amount> weeks] [<amount> days] [<amount> hours] [<amount> minutes]`

If you would like to run it yourself, know that it expects a node modules folder with Discord.js installed.
Credit to 6am (BergerAPI) for building a function to parse the input!
